# Test assignment - Backend developer

Need to create a service class that implements App\ShippingServiceInterface interface.

Service should send a command to Amazon's fulfillment network (FBA) to fulfill seller order using seller inventory in Amazon's fulfillment network (FBA) and return the tracking number as string for this order when method ship will be invoked.
